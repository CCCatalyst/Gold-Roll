# Gold-Roll
Assignment for ITT-310. This is the source code for my game application called gold roll

You can choose the difficulty of the game, and the game starts by giving the player a specific amount of credits. 
These credits are spent on the potential to pay out gold

hence the name gold roll

the goal is to reach the specified amount of gold before the credits run out. 

This is mainly just a simple proof of concept and is not very complex, but I hope to build more upon it.
